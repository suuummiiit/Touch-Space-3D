# 3D Object Manipulation with Hand Tracking (Python)

## Introduction

This Python project allows users to manipulate 3D objects displayed on screen using hand tracking.  It provides an intuitive and interactive way to interact with 3D models without needing a traditional mouse or keyboard. This project is useful for prototyping 3D interactions, creating immersive experiences, and exploring the potential of hand tracking technology.

## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python pyopengl
```

2. **(Optional) Virtual Environment:** It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url_here>
cd <project_directory>
```

## Usage

To run the project:

1.  Make sure you have a webcam connected.
2.  Navigate to the project's main directory in your terminal.
3.  Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will launch, and you should see a 3D scene with a tracked hand.  Move your hand to interact with the 3D objects.  Specific interaction details (e.g., rotating, scaling, translating) will be displayed in the application's interface.

## Features

*   Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe.
*   Intuitive 3D object manipulation through hand gestures.
*   Support for multiple 3D object types (This will depend on the objects your code actually handles).
*   User-friendly interface.
*   OpenGL rendering for smooth 3D visualization.
